I like to break it into chunks of unknown things to learn/tackle if I’m not sure of everything. So here, you probably have these buckets to learn about: setting up AWS to host a react app, a basic hello world API connector to talk to Open AI, and maybe even the basic react app, but you know that part better. Then once you know you can do the parts, start to draw out a flow. So user comes to site, site launches connection to open ai and triggers a chat (aka says hello), and then map out how responses and replies are fed into the api/app.
That’s one approach!
